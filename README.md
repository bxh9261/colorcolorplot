# colorcolorplot

As part of the RIT Fast Forward Program, I worked with astronomers Dr. Connelly and Dr. Kartaltepe as a research assistant. Among my many tasks was classifying and the shape and interactions of about 2000 galaxies into one big Excel spreadsheet, and presenting my findings. To present my findings clearly, I created a color-color plot using Python. I used pyplot from the matplotlib library, as well as numPy and astroPy packages to read in my data. While this was a small part of my overall project, it taught me the basics of python and plotting with code.
